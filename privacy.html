				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Privacy Settings</strong>

Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and very strict data encryption which include: 3 level of encryptions, physical access controls on every network point, and information access authorization controls.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
				<li>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.</li>
				<li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
				<li>We transmit personal information using secure software which encrypts information you input. Further, to the extent that we collect any credit card or bank account information from you, we will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Data Protection Officer</strong>
				<ol>
				<li>We have appointed a Data Protection Officer ("DPO") who is responsible for matters relating to privacy and data protection. Our DPO can be reached via e-mail.</li>
				</ol>
